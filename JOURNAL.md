# July 5th: Designed v1.0 and v2.0 of project!

To start off, I researched different projects that would fit my abilities and the hack club project guidelines. After finalizing the PCB Business Card as my project, I researched different tutorials that could help me understand the basic process of designing a PCB that could be shipped. I ended up finding the perfect resource right here at hack club: https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card.

I first watched the tutorial without beginning the design on my product. This was so that I did not just copy the tutorial and instead learned the techniques being used within it (very important sicne I am not too familiar with PCBs). After getting an understanding of the basics of PCB design, I noted down the components used in the resource and made sure they were cost-efficient and capable for my needs.

At this point, I began designing my PCB business card. To begin, I created the necessary schematic with the necessary parts using EasyEDA. Next, I converted this schematic into a PCB design and traced the necessary connections there. This took a solid chunk of time since I had to get familiar with each of these things while working on them. 

In my initial prototype (v1.0), I kept only the very backbone of the ideal end PCB, with one LED (and the neccessary associated components) and minimal silkscreen text. Once I had implemented these things, I moved on to adding more to the PCB. I first added text essential in any business card (name, skills, etc.) and added the two main features of versions 1.0 and 2.0 of my PCB Business Card: an NFC antenna and svg-based QR Codes linking to my socials. I also experimented with my visual design at this stage, testing the look of the PCB Business Card with different variations of layers (some shiny, some plain silkscreen, etc.), text sizes, fonts, and more.

After settling on my base version 1.0 visual and technical design, I moved on to preparing version 2.0 of my PCB Business Card. The main objective of this update would be to increase the number of LEDs on my PCB Business Card. This portion of development was probably the biggest obstacle I faced today. The reason for that was the fact that adding an LED required that many diffferent constraints be met: sufficient voltage, efficient wiring (parallel in this case, I believe this was the issue that stopped another hack clubber from implementing multiple LEDs in his project), and most importantly (annoyingly), connecting an entire new LED to the components already on the PCB design. This took me an insane amount of time. When attempting to trace the necessary connections on the PCB design, I constantly ran into scenarios that owuld result in short-circuiting, leading to an extremely tedious trial-and-error proocess to find the optimal connection paths. After playing a game of technical free flow, I had successfully added another LED to my PCB Business Card. This would be version 2.0 of my product.
