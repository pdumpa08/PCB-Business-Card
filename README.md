# Praneet's PCB Business Card
This is one of my first hardware-focused projects in the realm of PCB development. I've created a design that once assembled, I will bring with me to conferences and any number of other places where introducing myself would be very useful. The reason I settled on this project specifically is because it seemed to fit my technical understanidng of the conepts needed to successfuly build a project and it would be very useful in a lot of the program I participate in (my local chamber of commerce, FBLA, etc.)
